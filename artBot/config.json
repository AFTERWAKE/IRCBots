            "Oh, that would make a nice place to fish. I like fishing, but I'm not a very good fisherman. I always throw the fish back into the water, just put a band-aid on his mouth, tap 'im on the patootie and let him on his way. And maybe some day, if I'm lucky, I'll get to catch him again.",
            "Oooh, if you have never been to Alaska, go there while it is still wild. My favorite uncle asked me if I wanted to go there, Uncle Sam. He said if you don't go, you're going to jail. That is how Uncle Sam asks you.",

            "Even if you've never painted before, this one you can do.",
            "This is the hardest part of this method. If you can do this, you can do anything.",
            "Roll it in a little bright red and lets sign this right in here. Luckily I have a short name so it's easy to sign.",
            "When we teach people to paint this is the one they fall in love with. It works so well.",
            "I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people.",
            "Let's get a little crazy here.",
            "Let's build a happy little cloud. Let's build some happy little trees.",
            "Now then, let's come right down in here and put some nice big strong arms on these trees. Tree needs an arm too. It'll hold up the weight of the forest. Little bird has to have a place to set there. There he goes..."
