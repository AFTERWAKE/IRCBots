This is a new version of pointBot that uses a different framework called Sopel. Sopel.chat

A user would need to first install sopel and then can run the bot, using python3 too lazy to check backwards compatibility, using the command sopel -c pointBot.cfg.

People's points and gift points are tracked in a db provided by sopel so no weird txt files here. Sopel api is decenting documented so additions can be looked up on their website.``
