# IRCbots
Source code for bots used in the coop IRC @ coop.test.adtran.com

## List of bots in this repo:
#### Highfivebot
- Also known as mr_highfive. He responds to `o/`, `o//`, and a few combinations of that with other things, such as `\o/`
#### Doge
- He responds anytime someone says the word `wow`, `very`, or `such`
- He loves treats and being appreciated.
- He also knows tricks, but he usually only listens to his owner.
#### Magic Conch
- Ever in an argument about something? Conch will settle any dispute. Just ask her a question, she will reply with a yes/no-type response. She will even pick from a 'this or that' type scenario! Unsure of where something is? Ask her! She will use the help of her friend the Seahorse to find out where.
#### Seahorse
- Very useful in finding things, given that you first ask the Magic Conch. Otherwise, often very moody.
#### theCount
- A legendary bot created by David Stidham. [Check out his github repo for his original source code](https://github.com/dstidham23/countBot)
- Instructions are simple. At 8:30, 11:00, 1:30, and 4:00, theCount will start a counting game. You just keep counting until you reach the number theCount has chosen. For available commands, see [`IRCBots/theCount/README.md`](theCount/README.md)
#### dad
- For all things dad
- Dad is in Golang now! [Original Repo](https://github.com/alecwest/godaddyirc.git)
#### pointBot
- A bot that keeps track of arbitrary points given out by IRC users.
- Based off of theCount (Twisted IRC Client)
