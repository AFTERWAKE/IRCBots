# IRCbots
Source code for bots used in the coop IRC @ coop.test.adtran.com

## List of bots in this repo:
#### Highfivebot
- Also known as mr_highfive. He responds to `o/`, `o//`, and a few combinations of that with other things, such as `\o/`
#### Doge
- He responds anytime someone says the word `wow`, `very`, or `such`
#### Magic Conch
- Ever in an argument about something? Conch will settle any dispute. Just ask her a question, she will reply with a yes/no-type response. She will even pick from a 'this or that' type scenario! Unsure of where something is? Ask her! She will use the help of her friend the Seahorse to find out where.
#### Seahorse
- Very useful in finding things, given that you first ask the Magic Conch. Otherwise, often very moody.
